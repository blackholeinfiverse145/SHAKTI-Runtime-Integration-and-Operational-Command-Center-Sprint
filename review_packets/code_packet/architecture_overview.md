## 2. Core Architectural Design Decisions

### Configuration-Driven Layout
The visibility and grid sizing properties of the layouts are managed through a configuration scheme defined in `src/config/dashboard.config.ts`. The `DashboardProvider` exposes this configuration context to the page renderer, allowing zones to be customized or toggled dynamically without refactoring layout source files.

### Separation of Concerns
We enforce a strict separation between smart layout containers and presentational tiles:
- **Layouts (`src/components/dashboard/layouts/`)**: Smart containers. They invoke `TanStack Query` hooks, monitor state flags (isFetching, isError), parse query payloads, and pass parameters down.
- **Primitives (`src/components/dashboard/primitives/`)**: Presentational tiles. They are purely presentational, memoized, stateless React modules that receive metrics via props and render UI structures.

### Height-Stable Scroll Strategy
To ensure maximum page stability:
- Sibling cards in the same CSS grid row are kept visually identical in height regardless of backend dataset scaling.
- Layouts implement max-height boundaries (`max-h-[...]`) coupled with vertical scroll behaviors (`overflow-y-auto`) on all inner data tables or lists.
- Table layout components configure sticky headers (`thead` with solid backgrounds) to stay pinned at the top when users scroll internally.

## 3. Data Integration & Polling
Data sync is managed using TanStack Query, which maintains local caches and polls the FastAPI backend periodically on background threads (using intervals between 5s to 15s depending on metrics severity).

## 4. Error Boundaries & Fallbacks
- **Zone-Level Error Boundaries**: Each layout zone is individually wrapped in a React `<ErrorBoundary>`. If a widget experiences a component render crash, only that specific card shows a fallback recovery screen with a "Reload Zone" action, leaving the rest of the dashboard active.
- **Unified Card Shell**: The `DashboardCard` wrapper handles standard data loaders, empty indications, offline warning banners, and trace markers.
